## 🧠 Overview

**AutoCAD Express Tools** is an official extension suite developed for **AutoCAD** that enhances productivity by providing an expanded set of drawing aids, utility functions, and automation helpers not found in the core application. These tools are designed to speed up common drafting tasks, simplify editing, and provide specialized commands that help professionals work more efficiently.

Express Tools integrate seamlessly into the AutoCAD interface and add new commands for text manipulation, layer management, block handling, attribute editing, and drawing cleanup. They are widely used in architecture, engineering, construction, and design environments where repetitive tasks and detailed adjustments are part of daily work.

This add-on is especially valuable for CAD users who want to reduce manual steps, maintain consistency across drawings, and leverage extended functionality without leaving the AutoCAD ecosystem.
